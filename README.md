# Title - DiagnoseMe: Personal Health Decoder

# Introduction: People frequently struggle to recognize their health problems rapidly and accurately in today's fast-paced society. This may delay receiving the right medical attention and, in some situations, result in inaccurate self-diagnosis. Furthermore, it can be challenging for people to distinguish reliable sources from the rest due to the overwhelming amount of health information that is readily available online, some of which may be inaccurate

# This project seeks to provide a Personal Health Decoder application in recognition of these difficulties. For anyone looking to comprehend their health symptoms and possible underlying illnesses, this tool will act as an accessible, user-friendly resource.

The project is divided to three modules:
1.	Data Pre-Processing
2.	Data Visualization
3.	Disease Prediction
